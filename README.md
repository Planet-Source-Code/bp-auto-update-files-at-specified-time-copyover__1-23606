## Auto\-Update files at specified time \(copyover\)


</div>

### Description

This code will allow you to copy files at a specified time. I use it to update computers on a network at 3am when everyone is out of the building. It also has the API declarations for windows reboot/shutdown so they can easily be added for a reboot at a specified time.
 
### More Info
 
You will get an error unless you update the files that are being copied. The update code is in the timer control. The time to execute is also hard coded into the timer control, to change it go there.
